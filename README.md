Waterman
========

![](waterman.jpeg)

Just a guy spontanously bursting into water. I made this as a child by
throwing together various pictures (a jumping man in a suit, some splashes,
and a bursting waterbaloon) found online, probably in paint.NET.
I think this is not the original image but downsampled. I's the best
resolution I have as far as I am aware.
