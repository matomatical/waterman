Waterman
========

![](waterman.jpeg)

Just a guy spontanously bursting into water.
I made this as a child by throwing together various pictures (a jumping
man in a suit, some splashes, and a bursting waterbaloon) found online,
probably in paint.NET.
I think this is not the original image but downsampled. I have lost or
at least lost track of the original, but I had used it as my hotmail
profile picture, so I was able to recover this version.
Recently I did a shitty job of removing the background in Preview.

Anyway this is just here so I don't lose him again.
